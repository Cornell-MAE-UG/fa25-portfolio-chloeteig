## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a senior studying Mechanical Engineering and Business at Cornell. Next semester, I will begin my Early Masters in Engineering Management, a dual degree program between Cornell's Engineering and SC Johnson schools. I am especially interested in product development, and much of my academic and professional work has centered around accessible design. 

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
