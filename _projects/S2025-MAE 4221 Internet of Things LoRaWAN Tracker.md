## Overview

I completed this project as part of MAE 4221, working on a four-person team to design and build a handheld LoRaWAN connectivity tracker for use by non-technical volunteers. Community partners in Syracuse and Geneva needed a simple way to evaluate LoRaWAN coverage in the field in order to inform placement of sensors supporting public services such as flood monitoring, food access initiatives, and community infrastructure.

The project focused on translating real stakeholder needs into a robust, easy-to-use IoT system that could be deployed by volunteers with minimal training.

## System Concept & Design Approach

The tracker collects LoRaWAN signal data alongside GPS location and timestamps, storing results locally for later analysis. I contributed to designing a system that prioritized clarity and usability over raw technical complexity, ensuring the device could be operated reliably in outdoor environments.

Key design priorities included intuitive operation, clear feedback to the user, and reliable data capture during field testing.

## System Vision

We developed a clear system-level architecture to define how sensing, communication, storage, and user interaction components work together. This diagram guided both hardware integration and software decisions throughout the project.

## User Interface & Interaction Design

I worked on the development and refinement of the on-device user interface to ensure the tracker communicated status clearly to non-technical users. The interface provides immediate feedback on connection status, battery level, and GPS availability, reducing user uncertainty during field deployment.

We iterated the interface design to balance information density with readability and ease of use in outdoor conditions.

## Iterative Prototyping & Hardware Refinement

As a team, we iterated on the physical enclosure and internal layout to improve durability, ergonomics, and accessibility. The final design reflects multiple rounds of prototyping and testing, addressing issues related to component access, antenna placement, and overall robustness.

## Documentation & User Manual

To support long-term usability beyond the classroom, we created a detailed user manual explaining device operation, data handling, and deployment best practices. I contributed significantly to structuring and writing this documentation to ensure future volunteers and interns could use the tracker without additional training.

The documentation was designed to serve as a handoff resource for continued development and deployment by community partners.

## My Contribution

This was a four-person team project. My contributions included:
- Designing and refining the physical enclosure and system layout
- Contributing to embedded system integration and UI decisions
- Leading communication with community partners to gather requirements and share progress
- Supporting the creation and organization of the user manual
- Participating in prototyping, field testing, and design iteration

## Outcome & Impact

The final tracker successfully enabled real-time assessment of LoRaWAN connectivity across multiple locations. The project delivered a practical tool that supports equitable, community-driven deployment of IoT infrastructure while strengthening my experience in user-centered design, embedded systems, and stakeholder collaboration.
