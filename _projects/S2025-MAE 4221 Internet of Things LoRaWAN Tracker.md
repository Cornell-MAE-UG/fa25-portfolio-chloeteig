## **Overview**

I completed this project as part of MAE 4221, working on a four-person team to design and build a handheld LoRaWAN connectivity tracker for use by non-technical volunteers. Community partners in Syracuse and Geneva needed a simple way to evaluate LoRaWAN coverage in the field to inform placement of sensors supporting public services such as flood monitoring, food access initiatives, and community infrastructure.

We focused on translating stakeholder needs into a robust, easy-to-use IoT system that volunteers could deploy with minimal training.

## **System Concept & Design Approach**

The tracker logs LoRaWAN signal data alongside GPS location and timestamps, storing results locally for later analysis. I helped design a system that prioritized clarity and usability over raw technical complexity, ensuring the device operated reliably in outdoor environments.

I also contributed to defining the end-to-end workflow for data collection and handoff so partners could use the results without specialized tools.

## **User Interface & Interaction Design**

I worked on the on-device UI to communicate status clearly to non-technical users. The interface provides immediate feedback on connection state, battery level, and GPS availability, reducing user uncertainty during field deployment.

We iterated the interface to balance information density with readability and ease of use in outdoor conditions.

## **Iterative Prototyping & Hardware Refinement**

As a team, we iterated the physical enclosure and internal layout to improve durability, ergonomics, and accessibility. The final design reflects multiple rounds of prototyping and testing, including changes to component access, antenna placement, and overall robustness.

## **Documentation & User Manual**

To support long-term usability beyond the classroom, we created a user manual explaining device operation, data handling, and field deployment best practices. I did a lot of the partner communication and contributed significantly to structuring and writing the manual so future volunteers and interns could use the tracker without extra training.

## **My Contribution**

This was a four-person team project. My contributions included:
- Designing and refining the enclosure and internal system layout
- Supporting embedded system integration and UI decisions
- Leading communication with community partners to gather requirements and share progress
- Helping create and organize the user manual
- Participating in prototyping, field testing, and design iteration

## **Outcome & Impact**

The final tracker enabled practical, repeatable assessment of LoRaWAN connectivity across multiple locations. The project delivered a tool that supports equitable, community-driven deployment of IoT infrastructure and strengthened my experience in user-centered design, embedded systems, and stakeholder collaboration.
