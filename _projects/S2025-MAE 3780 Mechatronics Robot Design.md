## **Overview**

I completed this project as part of MAE 3780 (Mechatronics), working on a five-person team to design, build, and program an autonomous robot that navigated a structured environment and collected objects. The project required tight integration between mechanical design, electrical systems, and software control.

We built a robust, repeatable system that operated reliably under time constraints and physical interactions. The final robot and demonstrated strong performance across mechanical stability, sensing, and control.

## **Mechanical Design**

I contributed to the mechanical design of the robot, focusing on structure, organization, and impact tolerance. The chassis supported a multi-level layout that separated power, control, and sensing components to improve reliability and troubleshooting.

The aluminum bumper and side panels guided objects into the robot while also protecting the drivetrain from collisions. This geometry balanced weight, durability, and functional volume while staying within size constraints.

## **Electrical System & Integration**

I helped organize and integrate the electrical system, keeping wiring clean, power delivery stable, and components accessible for debugging. The design used multiple power sources to isolate high-current motor loads from sensitive control electronics.

Clear wire routing and layered component placement reduced failure risk and helped us quickly identify loose connections during testing and iteration.

## **Control Logic & Software**

I contributed to developing the robot’s control logic using Arduino-based embedded programming. The software coordinated motor control, sensor input, and timed motion sequences to execute a repeatable navigation strategy.

We implemented interrupt-based sensing to detect field boundaries and structured the program using modular motion functions. This approach improved readability, debugging efficiency, and control reliability.

## **Outcome**

The final robot demonstrated integrated mechanical, electrical, and software systems operating as a cohesive platform. The project earned a 100 and strengthened my skills in system-level design, rapid iteration, and translating theory into a functioning electromechanical system.
