## **Overview**

I completed this Open Design Project as part of MAE 2250 (Mechanical Synthesis). This project was my first full engineering design experience and focused on translating user needs into mechanical function through iterative design and prototyping. I worked as part of a five-person team to design and build a combined snow shovel and salt dropper intended to reduce physical effort while improving efficiency during winter maintenance.

The project emphasized mechanical synthesis, user-informed decision making, and realistic manufacturing constraints. The final design successfully demonstrated an integrated, mechanically driven solution and received an **A+**.

## **Design Concept & Mechanical Synthesis**

I helped design a system that integrates a wheeled snow shovel with a cam-driven salt dispensing mechanism. As the shovel moves forward, the cam mechanism induces controlled vertical motion of the salt box, enabling periodic salt release without electronics or additional user input.

This approach mechanically synchronizes snow removal and salt distribution while maintaining simplicity, durability, and suitability for outdoor use.

## **User Research & Iterative Design**

I contributed to distributing and analyzing user surveys focused on winter maintenance routines, ergonomic concerns, and usability challenges. Survey responses directly informed handle height, handle angle, force application, and salt dispensing frequency.

As a five-person team, we iterated the design through multiple prototype versions. We used user feedback and physical testing to refine comfort, stability, and mechanical performance.

## **Design for Assembly & Sustainability**

I prioritized design for assembly by favoring mechanically constrained joints over adhesive-based connections. This decision improves manufacturability, repeatability, and ease of repair. I also evaluated material choices with sustainability in mind, favoring wood over acrylic where possible to reduce plastic use and improve structural stiffness.

These choices ensured the design remained functional while supporting long-term viability and responsible material use.

## **My Contribution**

This was a five-person team project. My contributions included:
- Designing and fabricating the cam mechanisms used for salt dispensing
- Contributing to early concept development and mechanical synthesis decisions
- Supporting user survey distribution and analysis
- Participating in prototyping, testing, and design iteration
- Leading detailed technical documentation and written explanations

## **Outcome**

The final prototype successfully demonstrated a mechanically integrated snow removal and salt dispensing system. I earned an **A+** on this project, and it marked my entry point into hands-on engineering design, shaping how I approach iteration, user research, and mechanical decision making in subsequent projects.
