## **Overview**

I completed this Open Design Project as part of MAE 2250 (Mechanical Synthesis). Working on a five-person team, we designed and built a combined snow shovel and salt dropper intended to reduce physical effort while improving efficiency during winter maintenance.

The project emphasized mechanical synthesis, user-informed decision making, and realistic manufacturing constraints. The final design successfully demonstrated an integrated, mechanically driven solution.

## **System Concept & Mechanical Synthesis**

We integrated a wheeled snow shovel with a mechanically driven salt dispensing mechanism. As the shovel moves forward, the mechanism induces controlled motion of the salt box, enabling periodic salt release without electronics or additional user input.

This approach synchronizes snow removal and salt distribution while keeping the system simple, durable, and suitable for outdoor use.

## **User Research & Iteration**

I contributed to distributing and analyzing user surveys focused on winter maintenance routines, ergonomics, and usability challenges. Feedback informed key design decisions such as handle height and angle, force application, stability, and salt dispensing frequency.

As a team, we iterated through multiple prototype versions and used testing plus user input to refine comfort, mechanical performance, and repeatability.

## **Design for Assembly & Material Choices**

I prioritized design for assembly by favoring mechanically constrained joints over adhesive-based connections. This improved manufacturability, repeatability, and ease of repair.

I also evaluated material choices with sustainability in mind, favoring wood over acrylic where possible to reduce plastic use while improving stiffness and durability.

## **My Contribution**

This was a five-person team project. My contributions included:
- Designing and fabricating the cam mechanisms used for salt dispensing
- Contributing to early concept development and mechanical synthesis decisions
- Supporting user survey distribution and analysis
- Participating in prototyping, testing, and design iteration
- Leading detailed technical documentation and written explanations

## **Outcome**

The final prototype successfully demonstrated a mechanically integrated snow removal and salt dispensing system. This project marked my entry point into hands-on engineering design and shaped how I approach iteration, user research, and mechanically driven decision making in later work.
