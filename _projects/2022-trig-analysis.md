## **Overview**
EverSeat is a modular child car seat designed to grow with a child from infancy through the booster stage, eliminating the need for families to purchase multiple seats as their child grows. The project was developed as part of my senior design and early-stage startup coursework and focuses on three core goals: improving caregiver accessibility, reducing environmental waste, and maintaining uncompromising safety.

Traditional car seats are bulky, difficult to install, and inherently disposable due to rigid stage-specific designs. EverSeat reframes the car seat as a long-term platform rather than a sequence of short-lived products, combining modular engineering with user-centered design.

## **Modular Concept**
The core idea behind EverSeat is a single structural frame that supports multiple seating configurations over time. Instead of relying on detachable accessories that can be lost or misused, components are intentionally repurposed across stages to reduce part count and simplify transitions.

This approach allows the seat to adapt to a wide range of child sizes while maintaining consistent geometry, predictable load paths, and clear user interaction. The result is a system that feels intuitive to adjust while remaining structurally robust.

## **Engineering & Safety**
From an engineering standpoint, EverSeat was designed around a lightweight carbon-fiber composite shell to maximize strength-to-weight performance and long-term durability. Adjustable geometry and shared interfaces enable the seat to maintain structural continuity across all configurations.

To evaluate feasibility, we performed structural analysis using ANSYS under FMVSS 213–inspired crash loading conditions. These simulations showed factors of safety greater than 2.5 across all seating configurations, confirming that modularity does not compromise safety.

A Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (DFMEA) guided design decisions throughout the project, helping us identify and mitigate risks related to installation errors, accessibility limitations, and long-term wear.

## **Sustainability**
Sustainability was treated as a primary design constraint rather than an afterthought. EverSeat was designed to remain in service for significantly longer than traditional seats, reducing both material waste and repeated manufacturing.

Material selection prioritized durability, comfort, and environmental impact, including merino wool fabrics, bio-based polyurethane foam, cork, and carbon fiber. A lifecycle assessment conducted using Sustainable Minds demonstrated a meaningful reduction in CO₂ impact compared to conventional multi-stage car seats, validating the environmental benefit of a long-lifespan, modular system.

## **Business Case**
In parallel with technical development, I led the creation of EverSeat’s business case and commercialization strategy. This included market research, competitive benchmarking, cost modeling, pricing strategy, and investment planning.

EverSeat was positioned as a premium direct-to-consumer product priced to replace multiple traditional seats over a child’s lifetime. A full financial model and break-even analysis demonstrated a clear path to profitability after accounting for certification, tooling, and early manufacturing costs.

## **My Role**
I played a central role in shaping both the technical and strategic direction of the project. My contributions included leading customer research and QFD analysis, guiding DFMEA-driven design decisions, conducting structural feasibility analysis, and developing the full business case and financial model. I also coordinated report assembly and supported final presentations and documentation.
