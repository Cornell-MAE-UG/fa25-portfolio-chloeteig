## **Overview**

We designed Pawfect Rinse to address a common problem faced by dog owners: bathing dogs is messy, stressful, and physically demanding, particularly in small living spaces or when bathing alone. Existing solutions either rely on high-pressure hoses that cause anxiety for dogs or rigid tubs that are bulky, uncomfortable, and difficult to store.

Our goal was to create a portable, easy-to-use system that gently contains the dog, provides full rinse coverage, and reduces physical effort for the owner. Pawfect Rinse is a collapsible bathing and drying system designed for use indoors or outdoors and compatible with standard household water sources.

## **Design Concept**

Pawfect Rinse is built as a soft, inflatable enclosure that expands during use and collapses flat for storage. Once connected to a hose or showerhead, the system delivers water through an internal 360-degree hole pattern that provides even, gentle coverage without harsh spray.

A head-positioning buckle keeps the dog’s face outside the enclosure, reducing anxiety while maintaining full-body coverage. After rinsing, the same internal channels can be used to circulate air from a blow dryer, allowing both the dog and the product to dry more quickly.

## **Engineering & Analysis**

We selected thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as the primary material to balance flexibility, durability, and pet safety. TPU allows the structure to fold compactly while remaining resistant to water, heat, scratches, and repeated inflation cycles.

We performed analytical flow calculations and finite element analysis to verify safe operation under typical household water pressure. Results showed low per-hole flow rates comparable to gentle, low-flow shower heads, ensuring dog comfort without sacrificing cleaning effectiveness. Structural analysis confirmed acceptable stress levels and safety factors across repeated use cycles.

We used TRIZ principles, Quality Function Deployment (QFD), and DFMEA to guide design decisions and resolve trade-offs such as portability versus capacity and flexibility versus durability.

## **User Experience & Accessibility**

Pawfect Rinse was designed to reduce both physical effort and cognitive load for the owner. By containing the dog and eliminating the need to manage a hose, the system allows owners to focus on washing rather than restraint.

The collapsible form factor makes the product easy to store in apartments, transport, or use outdoors. Throughout development, we grounded design decisions in user research, including online reviews, forums, and survey feedback, to ensure the system addressed real pain points without adding unnecessary complexity.
